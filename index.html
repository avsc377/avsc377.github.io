			<strong>My Love,</strong>
		
			<br>
			Love was never about hugs and kisses,Its about how much you feel and think for that person from inside of your heart.
			How seriously you want to be together and hold each other in ups and downs in adverse situations. Love is all about 
			standing in storms in each others arms and dancing in rain. Love is all about doing action for happiness pf your partner.
			Love is all about of constantly thinking about someone in your heart and mind. Love is all about feeling butterflies in your
			Stoamch for someone. Love is all about getting goosebumps by feeling someone around you.
			
			<br><br>28th June 2020 , Time 3:15 PM. A meeting was arranged by GOD,Facilitated by Parents. This meeting was planned long ago from 
			ages and that has been commenced successfully as per the destiny. I met a girl,A Girl With White Earring,A Girl In Yellow Top,
			Blue Denim,Black Bellies and When She Came Her Face Was Wrapped in a white stole. You Know it was like God has wrapped something 
			beautiful for me since ages and i was waiting. People Interacted with each other but my heart was skipping its beat. 
			
			<br><br>I Had A Eye Contact, I felt nervous , My eyes were trying to see her but not to see her at the same time. Heart was pumping fast 
			and wishing let this flower bhi wrapped like this only. My Body shooked My Heart freezed, I breathed fast inside me and 
			A sudden goosebump hit me hard.
			
			<br><br>It was all new feeling for me. A boy inside me woke up and said you were never like this, Man How can you be nervous ? 
			She is just a girl only. You know people interaction well, why are you behaving like this. Suddenly Heart Raised The Voice and Said To Mind 
		    Hey You Overthinker Just Shut Up. This Voice From Heart Was So Commanding That Mind became silent and again heart is in power.
			Body Smiled From Inside after seeing this battle and so do lips.
